As can easily be seen, the increase of the tension parameter does not always
give better mean and maximum absolute errors because we prefer to follow the
data rather than an unknown function whose evaluations are not sufficiently
representative.

For this reason we have, in the following, considered only really rapidly varying
data sets for which the effect of increasing tension parameter values might be
beneficial. Two are taken from the literature (see [12] Tables 1 and 3) and the
other, given in Table II, is an experimental data set.

The given examples show that the effects of the tension parameter may be
predictable and desirable.

Moreover, our final example (Figure 8) shows the absolute need for an inter-
active tool that allows the user to control the shape of the reconstructed surface
in order to avoid meaningless results.

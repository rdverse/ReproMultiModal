Algorithm 677: C’ Surface Interpolation + 367

the values of the derivatives by assuming a cubic variation along each edge of
the triangulation and minimizing the integral over all edges in the triangulation
of the second derivative’s square.

Of all these methods, Nielson’s produces the best results and provides the most
appropriate reconstruction. But this method fails, too, when the data vary very
rapidly and, moreover, it does not allow any influence on the shape of the surface
by means of an input parameter.

The results of Nielson’s method have nevertheless suggested to us the possi-
bility of using a generalization of this method in our algorithm, obtained by
introducing a tension term in the functional to be minimized. More precisely, let
l represent the edge in the triangulation with endpoints P; and P,, and let I; be
a list of the indices representing the edges of the triangulation. We then define
T = Ujjcr,l,; as the union of all the edges of the triangulation and h,;(t) as a
cubic Hermite polynomial defined on l;;, which interpolates the given values /;
and f; and certain unknown values f;, f; at points P;, Pj.

In terms of this notation we define the set of cubic Hermite networks as

He{T] = {¢; ¢ = Flr with F € C'[D] and ¢ |, = hilt) i,j © Ir},

that is, the set of all C' functions which, restricted to 1;; edges ij © Ip are cubic
Hermite polynomials interpolating the given function values.

In this set an element ¢ is then chosen by solving, with respect to the unknown
partial derivative values, the following minimum problem:

Min Ip(¢)

~eHe[T}

eel 2 f se}
[sz] ats +P hy 5s, ay

where di,; is the element of arc length along |;; and p = 0 is a tension parameter.

The choice of the tension parameter value represents the interactive tool by
means of which the user is offered the possibility of acting on the shape of the
reconstructed surface.

As shown in the following examples, this value has a great influence on the
results of the interpolation problem.

In Figures 1 through 8 these examples explain the utility of introducing the
new tension term in the functional to be minimized in order to evaluate the
partial derivative values (henceforth, this method is indicated as M.T.F. for
Minimum Tension Functional) and to compare the results thus obtained with
those given by the software available today (ACM Algorithm 624 [13] where
G.D.E. stands for Global Derivative Estimates and L.D.E. for Local Derivative
Estimates).

First we considered the reconstruction of n = 26 point values (see [9] p. 173,
Figure 3) of the function

f(x, ¥) = 8/3.14*EXP(—8(x*x + y*y))

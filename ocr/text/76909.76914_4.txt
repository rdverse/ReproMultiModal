(slightly different from that of [9] to simulate more rapidly varying data) obtained
using the proposed algorithm with different tension parameter values (Figure 2
(a and b)) and the ACM Algorithm 624 (Figure 2 (c and d)). Table I also gives
the mean and maximum absolute interpolation errors on the 1600 grid points of
a40 x 40 uniform mesh on domain D.

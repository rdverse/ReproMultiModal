Algorithm 677: C' Surface Interpolation + 373

 

Fig. 9. Block scheme of the package.

CTANG constructs a triangular grid covering the convex hull of the considered
set of (x;, ¥;) points; the local optimization procedure used implements the max-
min angle criterion [9] and is realized by the MAXMN function (CTANG and
MAXMN are taken from Akima’s algorithm [2]). ADJAC provides the adjacen-
cies monodimensional array that, for each point, contains the indices of the
neighboring points in the triangulation. PDSTE estimates an initial approxi-
mation of the partial derivatives by means of the Klucewicz method [8]; these
estimations are used in the PDMIN subroutine as starting values for the iterative
method that solves the linear system obtained by minimizing the functional
Ip(¥). ORDGR sorts the rectangular grid points according to their positions in
the triangles, considered in ascending order number. INTRP performs punctual
interpolation by means of the nine-parameter discretized version of the Nielson
Triangular interpolant.

Appropriate use of the input parameter IC allows the user to save computa-
tional time if changing only part of the input data is desired; in fact, the MASUB
subroutine saves the information regarding the triangulation, the derivative
estimation, and the grid point sorting, and calculates only what is necessary for
the new data.

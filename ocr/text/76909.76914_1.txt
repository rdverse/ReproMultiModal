defined on a triangulation of the convex hull of the point set. These methods
work quite well on relatively smooth data sets, especially if they are obtained as
randomly generated point evaluations of some test functions, but they fail to
yield acceptable results when steep gradients are implied by the data. In this
case, in fact, the reconstructed surface exhibits unwanted oscillations near steep
gradients.

With the proposed algorithm we give the user the means for controlling
behavior of the interpolant surface, while still using a triangle-based method that
provides a C? global reconstructed function.

Particular attention has been paid to the computational complexity and the
numerical stability of the proposed method; we have thus been persuaded to
exclude the use of a type of bivariate analog of the spline under tension proposed
in [12] since it makes use of basic functions that are mostly exponentials with
consequent problems of numerical stability and high computational complexity.

2. THE ALGORITHM

As already mentioned, the proposed algorithm calculated a C‘ interpolant that is
defined in piecewise fashion over triangles. That means it consists of three
different steps:

(1) the domain D of the data is triangulated using the points P;,i=1,..., Nas
the vertices of the triangulation.

(2) acurve network is constructed interpolating the values f, and approximating
the first-order partial derivatives on the subset consisting of the union of all
edges of the triangulation.

(3) aC’ nine-parameter discretized version of a transfinite interpolation scheme
is used in order to construct the global interpolant.

We have decided, after careful analysis [3] of the known methods [5, 7~10], to
utilize, respectively, for steps (1) and (3), the max-min angle optimization
criterion due to Lawson [9] and the quadratic precision nine-parameter discre-
tized version of the minimum-norm Nielson scheme [10].

Step (2), on the contrary, represents the innovative part of the proposed
algorithm and gives an interactive tool for controlling the behavior of the
interpolant surface. In fact it consists of a new method based on a minimization
criterion for estimating the partial derivative values of the function to be
reconstructed. Since these values have great influence on the shape of the final
reconstruction, it is possible to act on the derivative evaluation in order to
suppress, or at least dampen, the unwanted oscillations of the surface near the
steep gradients.

Most of the methods known in the literature for numerical evaluation of the
partial derivatives of a function when only discrete values of it are given have
been taken into consideration and carefully analyzed [3]. The methods of Akima,
Little, and Klucewicz are local ones based on a weighted average of the slopes of
planes through some of the prescribed function values; Lawson’s method solves
for each given point a local weighted least-square problem for a bidimensional
quadratic polynomial; on the contrary, Nielson’s method is global and estimates
